## Notes

### To Do

- <s>Allow filtering by statement of the Transactions List and Transactions Categories views</s>
- Instead of just a field for rent, set it up so that an array can be used to add in any monthly transactions
- Color code the bar graph on the Categories page according to the $category_limits setting in config.php

### Ideas

**Pages:**

- Transactions
    - View all transactions
- Categories
    - Show spending per category
- Trends
    - Show a "timeline" linegraph depicting spending totals from each month
    - (either for all categories, or a particular category)
- Averages
    - Show the average of each category's totals
