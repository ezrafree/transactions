## Transactions

Transactions is a web application to visualize spending based on credit card statement transactions.

Currently Transactions only supports Capital One CSV exports of Statements. You must rename the downloaded CSV file to `Transactions-Statement-MM-DD-YYY.csv` and copy them into the `downloads` directory.
